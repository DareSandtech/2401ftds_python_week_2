Discrete data represent counts that can only take distinct values (e.g., number of cars), while continuous data represent measurements and can take any value within a range (e.g., temperature).\n","\n","**Choose the Right Type of Plot:**\n","\n","- **Histograms**: Ideal for showing the distribution of both discrete and continuous numerical datasets. They help in understanding the central tendency, spread, and shape of the dataâ€™s distribution.\n","- **Boxplots**: Provide a summary of one or more numeric variables. The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution. More suitable for continuous data but can be used for discrete data to highlight outliers and distribution spread.\n","- **Bar Charts**: Effective for discrete data, where each bar represents a category defined by discrete values. Useful for comparing quantities across different categories.\n","\n","**Bin Size Matters:**\n","\n","- For histograms, the choice of bin size can greatly affect the interpretation. Too many bins can make the data appear noisy and complex, while too few can obscure nuances in the data. Experiment with different bin sizes to find a balance that best represents the underlying distribution of both discrete and continuous data.\n","\n","**Ensure Readability:**\n","\n","- Make sure your axes are clearly labeled with understandable terms and units. Titles and axis labels should be concise but informative. This is crucial for both discrete and continuous data to avoid confusion about what the axes represent.\n","\n","**Use Appropriate Scales:**\n","\n","- Depending on the distribution of your data, using a logarithmic scale might be appropriate, especially if your data spans several orders of magnitude. This is often more relevant for continuous data but may apply to discrete data if the range is large.\n","\n","**Consider Data Distribution:**\n","\n","- **Scatter Plots**: Highly effective for visualizing relationships between two continuous variables. They help identify correlations, trends, and potential outliers in the data.\n","- **Dot Plots**: Suitable for discrete numerical data, especially when the data set isn't too large. Dot plots are great for showing frequency counts and distributions without aggregation.\n","\n","By incorporating these additional elements, your guide will cover a broader spectrum of scenarios encountered in data visualization, providing clearer guidance on how to appropriately represent both discrete and continuous numerical data."],"metadata":{"id":"8hgOaJzxw5d2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Lets look at the numbers and see if we can make sense of it\n","df[[\"Term\"]].head(20)"],"metadata":{"id":"81RpBIYgwJeG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['Term'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZozRiWl8ctDN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Now lets take what we know about visualisations and apply it.\n","# first we will use Matplotlib.Pyplot\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Assuming 'Term' contains a few unique categorical-like values\n","term_counts = df['Term'].value_counts()\n","plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n","plt.bar(term_counts.index.astype(str), term_counts.values, color='skyblue')\n","plt.title('Distribution of Loan Terms')\n","plt.xlabel('Term (months)')\n","plt.ylabel('Number of Loans')\n","plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to prevent overlap\n","plt.show();\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gFEzcxJCyo2r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import seaborn as sns\n","\n","# Using Seaborn to create a count plot which is more straightforward for categorical data\n","plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n","sns.countplot(x='Term', data=df, palette='Set2')\n","plt.title('Distribution of Loan Terms')\n","plt.xlabel('Term (months)')\n","plt.ylabel('Number of Loans')\n","plt.show();\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F2po1UzmziPQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Since our xaxis was not ordered we need to add more code to order the x-axis\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# 'Term' contains a few unique categorical-like values\n","term_counts = df['Term'].value_counts().sort_index()  # Sorts the index before plotting\n","plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n","plt.bar(term_counts.index.astype(str), term_counts.values, color='skyblue')\n","plt.title('Distribution of Loan Terms')\n","plt.xlabel('Term (months)')\n","plt.ylabel('Number of Loans')\n","plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to prevent overlap\n","plt.show()\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MZ3ZnKxn1IOP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Categorical Data**\n","\n","Categorical data can be classified into two types: nominal and ordinal.

They show the frequency or proportion of each category. For ordinal data, ensure that the categories are ordered as per their ranking to maintain the logical flow.\n","- **Pie Charts**: Useful for illustrating proportions in datasets with a small number of nominal categories. They are less effective for ordinal data or datasets with many categories or similar counts.\n","- **Line Charts**: Although less common for categorical data, they can be effective for ordinal data where the progression between categories is meaningful (e.g., stages of a process).\n","\n","**Label Clearly:**\n","\n","- Ensure that each category is clearly labeled and that the colors or patterns used are distinguishable from one another. Use a legend if necessary, particularly if colors are used to represent different categories.\n","\n","**Sort Your Data:**\n","\n","- For nominal data: Sorting the bars in a bar chart by frequency (e.g., descending) can make your chart easier to interpret.\n","- For ordinal data: Always maintain the inherent order of the categories to preserve their meaning (e.g., never sort \"poor\" to \"excellent\" in a non-logical order).\n","\n","**Keep Color Simple:**\n","\n","- Use a consistent, simple color scheme. Reserve the use of bright or varied colors to highlight specific data points of interest or to differentiate nominal categories clearly.\n","\n","**Avoid Clutter:**\n","\n","- In both pie charts and bar charts, too many categories can make the chart unreadable. Simplify where possible, perhaps by grouping smaller nominal categories into an 'Other' category. For ordinal data, ensure each category is visible but maintain the sequence integrity.\n","\n","**Additional Visualization Tools for Nominal Data:**\n","\n","- **Dot Plots**: Effective for displaying frequencies of nominal categories where the number of categories isn't too large.\n","- **Heatmaps**: Useful when visualizing the relationship between two nominal variables, showing how the frequency or intensity of outcomes changes across two dimensions.\n","\n","By tailoring your visualizations to the specific characteristics of nominal and ordinal data, you can more effectively communicate the underlying patterns and distributions in your data.
